# slaprinter

The *slaprinter* repository consist of thre sub projects from which two are softwares complementing each other and the third is essentially only a script for analytical purposes. After this short statement regarding what the repository actually contains, an introduction to our project seems to be in order.First of all, the repository you are looking at here contains the software developed for operating a sla 3D printer build by the TU Darmstadt iGEM Team for the 2015 contest. For a more complete information regarding the whole project visit the project [wiki](http://2015.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt). Or to be a bit more specific the description of the printer can be found [here](http://2015.igem.org/Team:TU_Darmstadt/Project/Tech/Hardware). Now to go on with the actual introduction, the printer developed uses steroelithography (*SLA*) as additive manufacturing method. This means the composition of an physical object is reached by illumination a photo-reactive resin (a fluid hardening under illumination with an according scope of wavelengths).
